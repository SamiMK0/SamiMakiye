I translate complex business processes into structured, maintainable web systems.
My goal is software that reduces friction, prevents errors, and scales with real operations.


I’ve worked on internal platforms and customer-facing systems that moved teams away from spreadsheets
and disconnected tools into centralized, reliable applications. My experience spans the full lifecycle
from understanding operational needs to building and refining production-ready solutions.
