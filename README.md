# SamiMakiye

I translate complex business processes into structured, maintainable web systems.
My goal is software that reduces friction, prevents errors, and scales with real operations.


I’ve worked on internal platforms and customer-facing systems that moved teams away from spreadsheets
and disconnected tools into centralized, reliable applications. My experience spans the full lifecycle
from understanding operational needs to building and refining production-ready solutions.

## What I Work On

- Designing and building full-stack systems used by real users across organizations with complex operational needs
- Automating workflows to reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and improve visibility for decision-making
- Developing reliable, scalable platforms that support daily operations and grow with organizational demand
- Working with startups and small businesses to translate business goals into professional digital products that showcase services and drive engagement


## How I Think About Software

- Software should reduce friction, not add complexity
- Systems must remain understandable as they grow and change
- Good engineering balances business needs, reliability, and long-term maintainability
- Real usage always matters more than theoretical perfection
